# ThreatIntelligence
Tracking APT IOCs

# Motivation

When analyzing an Incident or artifacts about an APT, the research reports published on the internet usually found with different given APT names and the IOCs in these reports are unually unique in nature. This can lead to difficulty in the analysis by a researchers specially who are new to CTI. To collect the TI during analysis several sources are required to be searched and it can be daunting tasks for analysts to collect IOCs, review and remove potential false positives.

We will try to include all publically accessible IOCs for specific APT group consolidate in one place.

# Methodology

The IOCs are collected from several sources publically accessible and new one as it published. The IOCs collected from these sources are fed into [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) and correlation are performed based on other threat feeds. The enrichments are done using different [MISP modules](https://github.com/MISP/misp-modules) and potential false positives are manually reviewed.


You are more than welcome for partifipation as its a work in progress by sharing the IOCs which are missing, idea for improvement to make it more actionable. For this you may raise an [issue](https://github.com/faisalusuf/ThreatIntelligence/issues) along with IOC and reference URL from where the IOCs is collected.
